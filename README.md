# Makerguide - FCS Edition
 This maker guide is intentionally unfinished, so that you can make it your own. The guide, in it's first form, has three simple projects with easy to understand HTML and CSS and will be easily sharable, remixable, and forkable. 

The Goal of this guide was to give new makers a place to begin, and by leaving it unfinished, we leave it up to you to decide what will suit your Maker community best.
